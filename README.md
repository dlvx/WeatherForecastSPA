##Weather Forecast SPA using AngularJS

A small Angular SPA based on the one from Anthony Alicea's course : Learn and Understand AngularJS

https://www.udemy.com/learn-angularjs/

I totally recommend this course for those who want to understand how angular works. The course covers very important aspects like dependency injection, services, directives, SPA routing, etc.
